Uses the **Giphy API** to post images.

This week's assignment makes use of AJAX calls in JavaScript.
The Webpages displays the following:
- Displays ratings per pictures
  - Ex: *Rating: G*
- Will add buttons based on user input
...

I also will use HTML attribute to store links for a still and animated version of the Giphys.
Using JavaScript will allow me to interchange which version the user see when the use click on an image.
